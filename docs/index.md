# Introduction

The Swan Book serves as a guide for writing homebrew for the Bandai WonderSwan and WonderSwan Color.

While this guide focuses on using the Wonderful toolchain, some of its parts are applicable for general development for the platform.

The guide assumes a basic familiarity with the C programming language.
